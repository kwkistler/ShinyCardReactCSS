Created with CodeSandbox

Design and develop apps using GPT-4 and Midjourney with prompts for SwiftUI, React, CSS, app concepts, icons, and copywriting

The code you provided is a complete example of creating an interactive card that changes its border gradient angle based on the mouse position. The gradient angle changes smoothly as the user moves their mouse over the card, creating a dynamic visual effect. It utilizes React hooks and styled-components to manage the state and styling. Great job!

In summary, this code creates a card with a translucent background and an animated border gradient angle based on mouse position. The card tilts and scales on hover, creating an interactive experience for users.

This is a solid example of how you can leverage React and styled-components to create interactive UI elements. If you have any further questions or need help with modifications, feel free to ask!
